      - header: Why physical therapy? 
        text: >
          If you're struggling with an injury, pain, stiffness, instability, or
          other limitations that affect your daily activities, physical therapy
          can help get you back to what you want to do. Using exercise, manual
          therapy, and education, Dr. Megan Barker can develop a specific program
          for you to optimize your movement and help you reach your goals.
      - header: Who we work with
        text: > 
          Dr. Megan Barker works with women and girls in Northern Virginia and
          District of Columbia who are motivated to take care of themselves in a
          holistic way. She treats dancers, figure skaters, gymnasts, yogis,
          pilates enthusiasts, and women with joint hypermobility (including
          hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and Hypermobility Spectrum
          Disorder). Her clients are looking for ways to feel their best and are
          willing to put in the consistent work to reach towards optimal health.

          spend valuable time with you to make sure you understand your injury,
          how to begin addressing it now, and leave you feeling ready to move
          forward with an individualized treatment plan.  Your goals,

      - header: Why health coaching?
        text: >
          You may feel lost, frustrated, and confused with where to turn on your
          health journey. You may feel overwhelmed with all you have to manage
          with work, home, and a health condition(s). With one-on-one health
          coaching, you can work with a Certified Women's Health Coach to develop
          a plan and take steps towards your health goals. It's an investment in
          yourself and your health. So whether you want to return to exercise,
          sleep better, or feel more energized, health coaching can give you the
          support and structure to reach those goals.
