  Dr. Megan Barker loves to learn. She has a passion for learning about her
  clients, what motivates and challenges them, and what they envision in their

  physical therapist and health coach.  Megan has treated a wide range of
  artistic athletes, ranging from young teens to professionals in Broadway

  reach their individual goals.
